### What I learned

- **Firebase Usage:** Learned to use Firebase for real-time data storage and synchronization, ensuring seamless updates as items are added or removed. Specifically, gained experience with Firebase functions like `initializeApp`, `getDatabase`, `ref`, `push`, `onValue`, and `remove`.

- **Favicon Integration:** Added custom favicons to improve the visual appeal of the web application. This also enhances the user experience by providing a recognizable icon in the browser tab, bookmarks, and other places where the web application is referenced.
